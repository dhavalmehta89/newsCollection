Hindu Rashtra
 
https://www.hindujagruti.org/hindu-rashtra/faq
The term ‘Hindu Rashtra’ does not have a parochial meaning such as ‘A Nation belonging to Hindus’. The ‘Hindu Rashtra’ is not a religious term either. Synonyms of this term are ‘Divine Kingdom’, ‘Ramrajya’. The ‘Hindu Rashtra’ actually implies an ideal kingdom. 
In the (soon to be established) ‘Hindu Rashtra’, all the subjects will be happy and blissful; and hence, it is a necessity not just for Hindus, but for the whole of mankind.
 
The highest common objective of all Hindu organisations throughout Bharat has been the establishment of the ‘Hindu Rashtra’. Further, daily activities of all Hindu organisations have been directed towards the welfare of the society, Nation and Dharma. 
 
This Convention helps to display that unity of Hindus. It will help get rid of the feeling of isolation among the Hindu organisations, and they will become active for the protection of Dharma with the confidence that they are as united as the ‘Pandavs’.
