Even after 70 years of India’s independence, the question still remains to address, whether we have really got the freedom; perhaps not fully ! Britishers left our country that only doesn’t really mean we received our independence, there are still many shackles from which we are pending to get our freedom; after having that only we can be able to say that we are become independent now in real sense ! Jai Hind !
